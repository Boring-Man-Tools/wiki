You can write in the chat by pressing `T`.

When you are in a server, you can switch between the server chat and the global chat by pressing `F2`.  
You can also hide the chat by pressing `F5`.

<!-- FIXME: chat bindings, emotes, emojis link -->
You can set [chat bindings](/wiki/chat/bindings/), write [emotes](/wiki/chat/emotes) and use [emojis](/wiki/chat/emojis) to express yourself up to a certain extent.
