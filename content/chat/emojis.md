## Trivia
<!-- FIXME: winter period, modding links -->
- When the [winter period]() is on in Boring Man, the `:chest:` emoji displays as a gift.
- When an emoji is placed in middle of a text, a space needs be present before and after it otherwise it won't be shown.
- All emojis can be [modded]():
    - Most of the emojis are named `spr_emoji_<emoji_name>`.
    - The `:heart:` emoji uses the spr_effect_heart sprite.
    - The `:medic:` emoji uses the spr_healing sprite.
    - The `:pineapple:` emoji uses the spr_nade_pineapple sprite.
- There is an emoji for `:zog:` in the sprites but it can't be used.
